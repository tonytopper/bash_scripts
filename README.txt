This is a very simple bash script for doing some Drupal Features deployments.  Lots of stuff could be done to make it better but there are better products out there to do the heavier lifting.  

Tested with:

* GNU bash, version 3.2.25(1)-release (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu)
* drush version 5.0-dev
* svn, version 1.6.11 (r934486)

Something like Capistrano or Jenkins would probably be the next stage to improve deployments.
